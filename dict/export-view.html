        export-view writes the current contents of the current view to an
        external file given by the string <i>filename</i>. The file is
        saved in PNG (Portable Network Graphics) format, so it is
        recommended to supply a filename ending in &quot;.png&quot;.
      <p>
        export-interface is similar, but for the whole interface tab.
      <p>Note that export-view still works when running NetLogo in headless mode, but
        export-interface doesn't.
      <p>
        export-output writes the contents of the model's output area to
        an external file given by the string <i>filename</i>. (If the model
        does not have a separate output area, the output portion of the
        Command Center is used.)
      <p>
        export-plot writes the x and y values of all points plotted by all
        the plot pens in the plot given by the string <i>plotname</i> to an
        external file given by the string <i>filename</i>. If a pen is in
        bar mode (mode 0) and the y value of the point plotted is greater
        than 0, the upper-left corner point of the bar will be exported. If
        the y value is less than 0, then the lower-left corner point of the
        bar will be exported.
      <p>
        export-all-plots writes every plot in the current model to an
        external file given by the string <i>filename</i>. Each plot is
        identical in format to the output of export-plot.
      <p>
        export-world writes the values of all variables, both built-in and
        user-defined, including all observer, turtle, and patch variables,
        the drawing, the contents of the output area if one exists, the
        contents of any plots and the state of the random number generator,
        to an external file given by the string <i>filename</i>. (The
        result file can be read back into NetLogo with the <a href="../dictionary.html#import-world">import-world</a> primitive.) export-world does not
        save the state of open files.
      <p>
        export-plot, export-all-plots and export-world save files in in
        plain-text, &quot;comma-separated values&quot; (<tt>.csv</tt>)
        format. CSV files can be read by most popular spreadsheet and
        database programs as well as any text editor.
      <p>
        If you wish to export to a file in a location other than the
        model's location, you should include the full path to the file
        you wish to export. (Use the forward-slash &quot;/&quot; as the
        folder separator.)
      <p>
        Note that the functionality of these primitives is also available
        directly from NetLogo's File menu.
      <pre>
export-world &quot;fire.csv&quot;
;; exports the state of the model to the file fire.csv
;; located in the NetLogo folder
export-plot &quot;Temperature&quot; &quot;c:/My Documents/plot.csv&quot;
;; exports the plot named
;; &quot;Temperature&quot; to the file plot.csv located in
;; the C:\My Documents folder
export-all-plots &quot;c:/My Documents/plots.csv&quot;
;; exports all plots to the file plots.csv
;; located in the C:\My Documents folder
</pre>
      <p>
        If the file already exists, it is overwritten.  To avoid this
        you may wish to use some method of generating fresh names.  Examples:
<pre>
export-world user-new-file
export-world (word "results " date-and-time ".csv")
export-world (word "results " random-float 1.0 ".csv")
</pre>

        Reports the pitch from this agent to the given agent.
      <p>
        If the wrapped distance (around the edges of the screen) is shorter
        than the on-screen distance, towards-pitch will report the pitch of
        the wrapped path. towards-pitch-nowrap never uses the wrapped path.
      <p>
        Note: In order to get one turtle to face another you need to use
        both towards-pitch and towards.
      <p>
        Note: asking for the pitch from an agent to itself, or an agent on
        the same location, will cause a runtime error.

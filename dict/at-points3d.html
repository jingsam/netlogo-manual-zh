      <p>
        Reports a subset of the given agentset that includes only the
        agents on the patches the given distances away from this agent. The
        distances are specified as a list of three-item lists, where the
        three items are the x, y, and z offsets.
      <p>
        If the caller is the observer, then the points are measured
        relative to the origin, in other words, the points are taken as
        absolute patch coordinates.
      <p>
        If the caller is a turtle, the points are measured relative to the
        turtle's exact location, and not from the center of the patch
        under the turtle.
      <pre>
ask turtles at-points [[2 4 0] [1 2 1] [10 15 10]]

          ;; distances (2,4,0), (1,2,1) and (10,15,10),

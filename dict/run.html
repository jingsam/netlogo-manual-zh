      <p>The <tt>run</tt> form expects a command task or a string containing commands.
         This agent then runs them.
      <p>The <tt>runresult</tt> form expects a reporter task or a string containing a reporter.
         This agent runs it and  reports the result.
      <p>
        If the input is a string, it runs in the agent's current context, which means it
        has access to the values of local variables, &quot;myself&quot;,
        and so on.        
        Note that you can't use <tt>run</tt> to define or redefine
        procedures.
        If you care about performance, note that the code must be compiled first which takes time.  However, compiled
        bits of code are cached by NetLogo and thus using <tt>run</tt> on
        the same string over and over is much faster than running different strings.
        The first run, though, will be may be many times slower than running 
        the same code directly, or in a command task.
     <p>Tasks are recommended over strings whenever possible.
        (An example of when you must use strings is if you accept pieces of code
        from the user of your model.)

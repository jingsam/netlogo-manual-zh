      <p>
        Used for creating breeded and unbreeded links between turtles.
      <p>
        create-link-with creates an undirected link between the caller and
        <i>agent</i>. create-link-to creates a directed link from the
        caller to <i>agent</i>. create-link-from creates a directed link
        from <i>agent</i> to the caller.
      <p>
        When the plural form of the breed name is used, an <i>agentset</i>
        is expected instead of an agent and links are created between the
        caller and all agents in the agentset.
      <p>
        The optional command block is the set of commands each newly formed
        link runs. (The links are created all at once then run one at a
        time, in random order.)
      <p>
        A node cannot be linked to itself. Also, you cannot have more than
        one undirected link of the same breed between the same two nodes,
        nor can you have more than one directed link of the same breed
        going in the same direction between two nodes.
      <p>
        If you try to create a link where one (of the same breed) already
        exists, nothing happens. If you try to create a link from a turtle
        to itself you get a runtime error.
      <pre>
to setup
   crt 5
   ;; turtle 1 creates links with all other turtles
   ;; the link between the turtle and itself is ignored
   ask turtle 0 [ create-links-with other turtles ]
   show count links ;; shows 4
   ;; this does nothing since the link already exists
   ask turtle 0 [ create-link-with turtle 1 ]
   show count links ;; shows 4 since the previous link already existed
   ask turtle 2 [ create-link-with turtle 1 ] 
   show count links ;; shows 5
end

      <p>
        Ties <i>end1</i> and <i>end2</i> of the link together. If the link
        is a directed link <i>end1</i> is the <i>root turtle</i> and
        <i>end2</i> is the <i>leaf turtle</i>. The movement of the <i>root
        turtle</i> affects the location and heading of the <i>leaf
        turtle</i>. If the link is undirected the tie is reciprocal so both
        turtles can be considered <i>root turtles</i> and <i>leaf
        turtles</i>. Movement or change in heading of either turtle affects
        the location and heading of the other turtle.
      <p>
        When the root turtle moves, the leaf turtles moves the same
        distance, in the same direction. The heading of the leaf turtle is
        not affected. This works with forward, jump, and setting the xcor
        or ycor of the root turtle.
      <p>
        When the root turtle turns right or left, the leaf turtle is
        rotated around the root turtle the same amount. The heading of the
        leaf turtle is also changed by the same amount.
      <p>
        If the link dies, the tie relation is removed.

      <p>
        The turtles that are connected by links in <i>link-set</i> but not
        included in <i>turtle-set</i> are placed in a circle layout with
        the given <i>radius</i>. There should be at least 3 agents in this
        agentset.
      <p>
        The turtles in <i>turtle-set</i> are then laid out in the following
        manner: Each turtle is placed at centroid (or barycenter) of the
        polygon formed by its linked neighbors. (The centroid is like a
        2-dimensional average of the coordinates of the neighbors.)
      <p>
        (The purpose of the circle of &quot;anchor agents&quot; is to
        prevent all the turtles from collapsing down to one point.)
      <p>
        After a few iterations of this, the layout will stabilize.
      <p>
        This layout is named after the mathematician William Thomas Tutte,
        who proposed it as a method for graph layout.
